Group admin can select who is going if he knows that the user is going. Also, an email should be sent to the group members to notify them about the new activity and ask them if they want to join the activity (going, maybe, not going) and when the user log in needs to see a notification from his group about the new activity. In the group page user can see the new activities and choose if he/she is going or not. At the same time, the new activity need to be sent back the back-end (program management department) to validate and approve the activity. After the activity get approved from the Program Management department the group can go to the activity. After they come back they can upload the activity report using the Wall tab where they can post their activity pictures and information.
3-      Us plus
Us plus is a place where users can enroll some different courses that provided from different sources. After enrolling in the desired course and watch the required videos user can get a certificate for attending the course. We prefer a digital certificate like a link so the user can add it to his resume on LinkedIn or other social media websites. And a PDF copy needs to be sent to his email.
 
4- Events functionality:
Sometimes the organization manages and handle different types of events. Some of those events are free, and some are not. We need a plugin to show the new events on the main page so guest and users can purchase the tickets.  Anyone can buy the tickets not only registered users. Information like date, time, location details, a map for the location, and the price.
 
- Information pages: need different pages to display the organization information.

- Main page: need our social media accounts to be displayed on the main page such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
